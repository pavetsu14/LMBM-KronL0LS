# LMBM-KronL0LS

This repository contains the files needed to run LMBM-KronL0LS method with python. The method has been developed for solving pairwise interaction prediction problems with L0-penalized least squares under four different experimental settings. The method can handle both binary and continuous interaction affinity labels. The method utilizes nonsmooth optimization method called Limited Memory Bundle Method for solving the developed bi-objective optimization problem and generalized vec trick for forming implicit Kronecker product kernel matrices.

Pairwise interaction prediction problems are closely related to drug-target problems and the results might be useful e.g. in the field of drug discovery.

The method has been introduced in the article: 

Special thanks to my colleagues Antti Airola, Napsu Karmitsa and Tapio Pahikkala for co-operation and the development of the methods and techniques utilized in this work.
