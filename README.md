# LMBM-Kronl0LS

This repository contains the files needed to run LMBM-Kron$\ell_0$LS method with python. The method has been developed for solving pairwise interaction prediction problems with L0-penalized least squares under four different experimental settings. The method can handle both binary and continuous interaction affinity labels. The method utilizes nonsmooth optimization method called Limited Memory Bundle Method and generalized vec trick for forming implicit Kronecker product kernel matrices.

Pairwise interaction prediction problems are closely related to drug-target problems and the results might be useful e.g. in the field of drug discovery.
